# 10 - Stacks

## Installing and using stack data structure

- For a stack which is organized as a linked list, you must first create your Node and Linked List constructor files. Within the new Stack constructor, you need to then assign a new variable, _storage, as a new Linked List. The Stack constructor will contain the modules which will allow you to push to the end of the stack, pop off the end of the stack, peek to see the node at the end, and confirm whether or not the stack was empty.
